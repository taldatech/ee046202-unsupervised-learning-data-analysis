Null & Alternative Hypotheses** -  Formulate the null hypothesis $H_0$: $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ (that the observations are the result of pure chance) and the alternative hypothesis $H_1$: $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$ (that the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation).\n",
    "* **2. Test Statistic** - Identify a test statistic that can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. It is a value computed from sample data. The test statistic is used to assess the strength of evidence in support of a null hypothesis.\n",
    "    * A **statistic** is a real-valued function of the data. For example, the sample mean: $W(X_1, X_2,..., X_n)= \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n}{n}$ is a statistic.\n",
    "    * A **test satistic** is a statistic on we which we build our test.\n",
    "    * **Acceptence Region** $A$ - A *set* $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is defined to be the set of all possible values of the test statistic for which we accept $H_0$.\n",
    "    * **Rejection Region** $R$ - A *set*  $R = \\mathbb{R} - A$ is defined to be the set of all possible values of the test statistic for which we reject $H_0$ and accept $H_1$. "

The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence **against** the null hypothesis.\n",

Our null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that  $\\mu_{d_i} = 0$ - the two classifiers are similar. However, we do not know the variance of the random variable. We can assume that: $$ d_i \\sim \\mathcal{N} (\\mu', \\sigma) $$ where the parameters are unknown. This assumption makes sense in the *limit of large data* and under the (wrong) assumption that each entry of the table is drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution.

    "* A Uniformly Most Powerful (UMP) test has the most statistical power from the set of all possible alternate hypotheses of the same size $\\alpha$.\n",
    "* The UMP doesn’t always exist, especially when the test has nuisance variables (variables that are irrelevant to your study but that have to be be accounted for).\n",
    "* However, if the UMP does exist, you can use the Neyman-Pearson lemma (NPL) to find it.\n",
    "* A UMP test is usually defined in terms of a uniformly most powerful rejection region (UMPCR) (also called a “critical region”).\n",
    "    * A region $C$ of size $\\alpha$ is the UMPCR for testing a simple null hypothesis against a set of alternate hypotheses if it is the “best” critical region.\n",
    "    * The “best” critical region is one that minimizes the probability of making a Type I or a Type II error.\n",
    "        *  In other words, the UMPCR is the region that gives the smallest chance of making a Type I or II error. It is also the region that gives a UMP test the largest (or equally largest) power function.\n",
    "* Formal definition: a test defined by a critical region $C$ of size $\\alpha$ is a uniformly most powerful (UMP) test if it is a most powerful test against each simple alternative in the alternative hypothesis $H_A$. The critical region $C$ is called a uniformly most powerful critical region of size $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* UMP and the **Neyman-Pearson Lemma**:\n",
    "    * The Neyman-Pearson lemma can tell you the best hypothesis test if you have a simple null hypothesis and a simple alternative hypothesis. \n",
    "        * If you have multiple hypotheses (also called a composite hypothesis), the NPL can be extended to all individual alternate hypotheses. \n",
    "        * Composite hypotheses have multiple options for solutions. For example, $\\sigma^2 > 8$ is a composite hypothesis because it doesn’t specify a value for $\\sigma^2$\n",
    "    * The basic idea is that you test each simple hypothesis in turn to see if it is the UMP out of all possibilities.\n",
    "    * Formally:\n",
    "        * Let $C$ be a class of tests for testing $H_0$: $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ versus $H_1$: $\\theta \\in \\Theta^c_1$. A test in class $C$, with power function $\\beta(\\theta)$, is a uniformly most powerful (UMP) class $C$ test if $\\beta(\\theta) \\geq \\beta'(\\theta)$ for every $\\theta \\in \\Theta^c_0$ and every $\\beta'(\\theta)$ that is a power function of a test in class $C$.\n",
    "        * In more simple terms, this is really just telling you that the UMP test is the one with the biggest power function (out of all tests of the same size $\\alpha$). $\\Theta_0$ is the set of all possible values for $\\theta$ under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "        * The same statement can be rewritten using the **likelihood ratio test**. Let’s say you had two simple hypotheses $H_0$: $\\theta = \\theta_0$ and $H_1$:$\\theta = \\theta_1$. In order to find the most powerful test at a certain $\\alpha$ level (with threshold $\\eta$), you would look for the likelihood-ratio test which rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis when: $$ \\Lambda(x) = \\frac{L(x|\\theta_0)}{L(x|\\theta_1)} \\leq \\eta $$ Where $$P(\\Lambda(X) \\leq \\eta|H_0) = \\alpha $$\n",
