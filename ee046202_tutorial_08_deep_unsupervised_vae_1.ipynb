    "    * But do we really need 784 values to represent a digit? The answer is probably no. We belive that the data lies on a low-dimensional space which is enough to describe the observartions. In case of MNIST, we can choose to represent digits as one-hot vectors, which means we only need 10 dimensions. So we can **encode** high-dimensional observations in a low-dimensional space.\n",
    "    * But how can we learn meaningful low-dimensional representations? The general idea is to reconstruct or, **decode** the low-dimensional representation to the high-dimensional reperesentation, and use the reconstruction error to find the best representations (using the gradients of the error). This is the core idea behind **autoencoders**."

When collecting data from the real world, it is safe to assume that it would not be deterministic, that is, we assume that there is some underlying distribution. More formally, in the case of linear regression, we assume that the $y$ is indeed a linear deterministic function of the input, but with added noise $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ which leads to $y = \\theta^T x + \\epsilon \\rightarrow p(y|x, \\theta) = \\mathcal{N}(\\theta^T x, \\sigma^2)$\n",
    "    * We get: $$ NLL(\\theta) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\big[ \\big( \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma^2} \\big)^{\\frac{1}{2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(y_i - \\theta^Tx_i)^2} \\big] = -\\frac{N}{2} \\log (2\\pi \\sigma^2) + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\theta^Tx_i)^2 $$ or in the neural network case: $$ NLL(\\theta) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \\big[ \\big( \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma^2} \\big)^{\\frac{1}{2}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(y_i - f_{NN}(x,z))^2} \\big] = -\\frac{N}{2} \\log (2\\pi \\sigma^2) + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f_{NN}(x,z))^2 $$ "
