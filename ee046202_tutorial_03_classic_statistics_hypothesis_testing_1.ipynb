    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null & Alternative Hypotheses** -  Formulate the null hypothesis $H_0$: $\\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ (that the observations are the result of pure chance) and the alternative hypothesis $H_1$: $\\theta \\in \\Theta_1$ (that the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Test Statistic** - Identify a test statistic that can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. It is a value computed from sample data. The test statistic is used to assess the strength of evidence in support of a null hypothesis.\n",
    "   * A **statistic** is a real-valued function of the data. For example, the sample mean: $W(X_1, X_2,..., X_n)= \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n}{n}$ is a statistic.\n",

The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence **against** the null hypothesis.\n",

Common values are 5% and 1%.). If $p \\leq \\alpha$ (the observed effect is statistically significant), the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid."

    "The *observed* data is a random variable $X$. Under $H_0$ we have $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\frac{1}{9})$ and under $H_1$ we have $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(1, \\frac{1}{9})$. We suggest the following test: set a threshold $c$. If the obsereved value of $X$ is less than $c$, choose $H_0$ ($\\theta=\\mathbb{E}[X]=0$), otherwise, choose $H_1$ ($\\theta=\\mathbb{E}[X]=1$). To find the best $c$ we use the required $\\alpha$, that is, we demand: $$ P(\\text{type I error}) = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | H_0) = P(X>c|H_0) = P(W>c) = 1 - \\phi(3c) $$ (the last transition is due to the fact that we assume $H_0$ and $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\frac{1}{9})$, which is not the standard distribution). It holds that $P(\\text{type I error}) = \\alpha$, thus we get: $$ c=\\frac{1}{3}\\phi^{-1}(1- \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{3}\\phi^{-1}(1-0.05) = \\frac{1}{3}\\phi^{-1}(0.95) = 0.548 $$"
